# Tamagotchi-Project
Class mini project

The commented out code in the functions feed, bedtime, and play work succesfully!!
However, I am unable to reverse them so that they can revert back to hidden or normal opacity so that they can be clicked again

I'd like to animate the ball and taco to go from the feed and play button to the pet and then disappear


!!!
The Game Over html/css/js work and bring you back to play the game again

...
But the Game Over code at the end of the game does not bring you to the game over window
