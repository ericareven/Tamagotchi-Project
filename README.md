# Tamagotchi-Project
Class mini project

The commented out code in the functions feed, bedtime, and play work succesfully!!
However, I am unable to reverse them so that they can revert back to hidden or normal opacity so that they can be clicked again

I'd like to animate the ball and taco to go from the feed and play button to the pet and then disappear

BUGS:

when sleep button is pressed, the functions runs but "undefined" populates first in the level section

evolve code is not working

________________________________________________________________________________
What to change:

Level should not go below zero

Evolve button should disappear after each click
